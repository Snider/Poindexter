// Package poindexter provides sorting utilities and a KDTree with simple
// nearest-neighbour queries. It also includes helper functions to build
// normalised, weighted KD points for 2D/3D/4D and arbitrary N‑D use-cases.
//
// Distance metrics include Euclidean (L2), Manhattan (L1), Chebyshev (L∞), and
// Cosine/Weighted-Cosine for vector similarity.
